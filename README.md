# 🛫 Mitigating Bird Strikes in Aviation – Interactive Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **wildlife strike incidents in aviation** using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and **Tableau**.  
The objective is to identify **patterns, risks, and mitigation strategies** to:  
- Improve **flight safety**  
- Reduce **financial losses**  
- Enhance **communication protocols**  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Data  
- **Tools:** Anaconda · Jupyter Notebook · Tableau  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Wildlife strike dataset  
  - Python libraries for preprocessing & analysis  
  - Tableau for visualization  

---

## 🚀 Key Findings  

### 🐦 Most Common Bird Species  
- **Unknown bird-medium** → 472 precautionary landings  
- **Unknown bird-large** → 269 precautionary landings  
- These species often caused **engine shutdowns, aborted take-offs, precautionary landings**.  

### 🌍 Geographic Trends  
- **Top States:** California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Texas  
- **Top Airports:**  
  - Dallas/Fort Worth (2,941 strikes)  
  - Sacramento (1,856 strikes)  
  - LaGuardia (1,579 strikes)  

### ✈️ High-Risk Flight Phases  
- **Approach phase** under **clear skies** (“No Cloud”) had the highest risk (13,230 incidents).  

### ⚠️ Impacts of Strikes  
- **Precautionary landings** most common (24,601 cases).  
- **Engine shutdowns & aborted take-offs** less frequent.  
- Even with warnings → **922 incidents still caused damage**, showing a need for **pilot training**.  

### 💰 Financial Impact  
- **Business Airlines** → $53.96K loss  
- **United Airlines** → $11.9K loss  
- **Delta Airlines** → $8.32K loss  
- Costs peaked in **2001 ($14.2K)** and surged again in **2010**.  

### 📡 Communication Gaps  
- **58.25% strikes occurred without warnings**.  
- Even with warnings, damage still occurred → **pilot response needs improvement**.

## 🧭 Business Insights & Recommendations  
✔️ Deploy **advanced wildlife detection systems**  
✔️ Implement **airport habitat modification** to deter birds  
✔️ Build **airline-specific mitigation strategies** (esp. Business Airlines)  
✔️ Enhance **pilot training & response protocols**  
✔️ Strengthen **communication & early-warning systems**  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
Wildlife strikes remain a **serious threat to aviation safety and finances**.  
Data-driven solutions can help reduce risks by:  
- **Improving detection systems**  
- **Managing habitats**  
- **Training pilots**  
- **Enhancing communication**  

These strategies will **minimize risks, cut financial losses, and improve flight safety**.
